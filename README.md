# Blind75

## Summary

This repo aims to track my personal progress on Blind75 questions in preparation for technical assessments in the upcoming application season for internships/jobs. The questions attempted are based on the Blind75 questions. A reference to the questions and their order can be found [here](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).
